      <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
      <div class="essay">
         <h2>The Chapter begins with the axiom that Any visualization is a model. And more adequately a model fits whatever it stands for without being needlessly complex, and the easier it is for its intended audience to interpret it correctly, the better it will be.</h2>
         <h2>Also, there are some dubious models. Some of the models were created badly on purpose in order to mioslead the audience. More oftenly, some daulty models are the result that designer didn't pay proper attention to the data. Good visualizations shouldn't oversimplify information. They need to clarify it. In many cases, clarify a subject requires increasing the amount of information, not reducing it.</h2>

         <h2>There are three reasons/causes that author holds that make people mistaken the visualization.</h2>
         <h3><br>   Patternicity Bug </br></h3>
         <h3><br>   Storytelling Bug </br></h3>  
         <h3><br>   Confirmation Bug </br></h3>

      <h1>   Mind Bug I: Patternicity   </h1>
<div class="essay">
   <h2>Due to the capacity for detecting patterns, visual and otherwise, people can't see the truth from the visualization. Randomness and uncertainty in data render many news stories and cisualization completely meaningless.</h2>
     </div>
<h1>   Mind Bug II: Storytelling   </h1> 
<div class="essay">
   <h2>Hummans feel patterns first and build narratives based on them, and then we look for ways of justifying the rationality of the narrative.</h2>
<h2>Storytelling can be a potent tool for communicating effectively, but it is dangerous if it blinds us towards evidence that should compel us to tweak or discard our models.</h2>
  </div>
<h1>   Mind Bug III: Confirmation   </h1> 
<h2>Once there is an attack on our belief, it will be seen as personal. We try to avoid looking at it.</h2>
<h2>Therefore, the way we present information matters as much as the soundness of the information itself.</h2>
