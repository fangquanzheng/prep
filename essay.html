         <h2>The Chapter begins with the axiom that Any visualization is a model. And more adequately a model fits whatever it stands for without being needlessly complex, and the easier it is for its intended audience to interpret it correctly, the better it will be.</h2>
         <h2>Also, there are some dubious models. Some of the models were created badly on purpose in order to mioslead the audience. More oftenly, some daulty models are the result that designer didn't pay proper attention to the data. Good visualizations shouldn't oversimplify information. They need to clarify it. In many cases, clarify a subject requires increasing the amount of information, not reducing it.</h2>
